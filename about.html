                Welcome to my blog! This page is for my class at Michigan State University. I am currently a senior studying Information Science. I created this blog as part of my coursework for MI349, where I am learning about web development.

            <p>
                Once I graduate, I hope to work in database management or data architecture. Eventually, I would like to get a master's degree in data science. Outside of my schooling, I am involved in the marching band here at MSU, I am in a service sorority, and I love to spend time with the people I care about.
